NOTE: this project is still a **work in progress** and the developer began lazy about it ðŸ¦¥ (I got a better network environment.. It became less useful to me.)

The project is related with [this script](https://github.com/FINCTIVE/download-videos)

*If you're going to use this project, you should read the code and the script.*

## feature

- download videos from Youtube, Bilibili, m3u8 links
- restart downloading when the network is too awful
- simple built-in configurations inside, deploy to use it without hesitation.
